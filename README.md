# Lab 6: Visual Studio Code and Streamlit

---

üìò Introduction


In this lab, we transition from mastering OpenAI's API capabilities in Python‚Äîranging from text generation and image creation to transcription and prompt engineering on Colab‚Äîto applying these skills towards developing impactful AI projects for social good. As we move forward, the focus shifts to making these projects accessible through user-friendly web applications. To achieve this, we will introduce you to **Streamlit**, a powerful tool that simplifies the process of building and deploying data applications. Additionally, we will guide you through setting up your development environment in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, complete with the Python Extension and Streamlit, ensuring a seamless workflow for your AI projects. 

By the end of this lab, you will be well-equipped to bring your AI-driven solutions to a wider audience, leveraging the power of web applications to make a positive impact in society.

## Lab Starts Here

## üîß 1.1 Installing Python and VS Code

1. Navigate to the official Python [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of python that is compatible with your device. 

2. Navigate to the VS Code [platform](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install the latest version compatible with your device.

3. [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)Python extension for VS Code.

4. Configure Python in VS Code:
    - Open VS Code and open the command palette.
        - For Mac, press Cmd+Shift+P
        - For Windows, press Ctrl+Shift+P
    - Type "Python: Select Interpreter" and press Enter. Choose the Python            interpreter you installed (e.g., "Python 3.13.6").

## üßë‚Äçüíª 1.2 Working with VS Code

1. Open VS Code.

2. Create a folder using ‚ÄúOpen Folder‚Äù found on the top of the screen under ‚ÄúFile‚Äù.

3. From the File Explorer toolbar, select the New File button on the folder. Name it text_generation.py.
    a. By using the .py file extension, you tell VS Code to interpret this file     as a Python program, so that it evaluates the contents with the Python          extension and the selected interpreter.
    b. To test if your python interpreter is working, paste the following code      in your text_generation.py file.

```Python
print("Hello World!")
```
4. Run the code using the ‚ñ∑ button on the top right corner. Running the code should display the phrase ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù in the terminal

5. Finally, to finish setting up your environment for OpenAI development, we need to install the OpenAI library. Input the following command in your **terminal** and type enter, **not** in the Python file.

```Python
pip install --upgrade openai
```

- **Possible issue**: If the above command does not work, try replacing pip with pip3 For further information, refer to the documentation here: [Quickstart tutorial - OpenAI API.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python)
  
- If still not working, try **‚Äúpy -m pip install --upgrade openai‚Äù** (not including quotation mark)
  
- **Possible issue**: If you see an **error** ‚Äúpip The term 'pip' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, or operable program‚Äù, it is possible you have different versions of Python. Try reinstall Python, or the [solution post](https://www.codewithharry.com/videos/general-python-errors-1/)
  
- **Possible issue**: If you are on a Mac and you get either of the following errors:
    - zsh: command not found: python
    - zsh: command not found: py
    - Make sure Python is actually installed after downloading it to your            computer.
